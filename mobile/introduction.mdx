```## Data Flow

### Local-First Architecture

1. All data stored locally in Isar database
2. UI reads from local database (instant)
3. Background sync to server
4. Real-time updates via WebSocket
5. Optimistic UI updates

### Sync Strategy

    participant User as 👤 User
    participant UI as UI Layer
    participant Local as Isar DB
    participant Sync as Sync Service
    participant Server as Backend
    
    User->>UI: Performs Action
    UI->>Local: Update Local Data
    Local-->>UI: Instant Feedback ⚡
    
    par Background Sync
        Sync->>Server: Sync to Server
        Server-->>Sync: Confirmation
        Sync->>Local: Update Status
        Local-->>UI: Confirmed ✓
    end
