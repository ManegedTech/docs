## Overview

This guide will help you set up both the Maneged backend server and mobile app for development. By the end, you'll have a fully functional local environment with real-time messaging capabilities.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js 16+, Flutter 3.16+, and Git installed on your system.
</Note>

## Backend Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manegedtech/Maneged_Socket.git
cd Maneged_Socket
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Appwrite Configuration
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id

# Collections
COLLECTION_USERS=users
COLLECTION_MESSAGES=messages
COLLECTION_CONVERSATIONS=conversations
COLLECTION_ORGANIZATIONS=organizations
COLLECTION_TASKS=tasks

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# Firebase Admin SDK (for push notifications)
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./firebase-admin-sdk.json
```

<Tip>
  Get your Appwrite credentials from the [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io/console). Create a new project if you haven't already.
</Tip>

### 4. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`. You should see:

```
ðŸš€ Server running on port 3000
ðŸ“¡ WebSocket server ready
âœ… Connected to Appwrite
```

## Mobile App Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aryanutkarsh/Maneged_Android.git
cd maneged_mobile
```

### 2. Install Flutter Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Appwrite Configuration
APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id

# Collections (must match backend)
COLLECTION_USERS=users
COLLECTION_MESSAGES=messages
COLLECTION_CONVERSATIONS=conversations
COLLECTION_ORGANIZATIONS=organizations

# Backend API
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Run the App

Connect a device or start an emulator, then run:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Verify Installation

### Test Backend API

Test the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-19T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Test Mobile App

1. Sign up with a new account
2. Create or join an organization
3. Send a test message
4. Verify real-time delivery

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Backend won't start">
    - Check that all environment variables are set correctly
    - Verify Appwrite credentials and project ID
    - Ensure port 3000 is not already in use
    - Check Node.js version (16+ required)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mobile app build fails">
    - Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
    - Check Flutter version: `flutter --version` (3.16+ required)
    - Verify `google-services.json` is in the correct location
    - Ensure Android SDK is properly installed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WebSocket connection fails">
    - Verify the backend server is running
    - Check the WebSocket URL in mobile app `.env.local`
    - For Android emulator, use `10.0.2.2:3000` instead of `localhost:3000`
    - Check firewall settings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development Tips

<Tip>
  **Use the Developer Page**: The mobile app includes a built-in developer page (`Settings > Developer Tools`) with connection diagnostics and testing tools.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Production Deployment**: Before deploying to production, update all security credentials, enable HTTPS/WSS, and configure proper CORS policies.
</Warning>
